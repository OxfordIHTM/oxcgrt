The [Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/covid-19-government-response-tracker) is a project that gathered data on government measures taken to address COVID-19 from 2020 to 2023 rigorously and consistently. It involved over 1500 volunteers and provided real-time information on various policy responses worldwide up to 2022. As of May 2023, most countries had lifted their pandemic-related policies, prompting the project to shift its focus to analysing the collected data and conducting research on the impacts and determinants of these responses.

## The OxCGRT data

The OxCGRT has made its datasets available, including the different versions, in a systematic and consistent way so as to aid those who require information have access to it efficiently. There have been three release versions of the OxCGRT datasets with the version dictated upon by its data structure which in turn is based on the methodology that the OxCGRT research team have developed and employed.

### Legacy version 1

**Start date:** March 2020
**Retirement date:** 25 April 2020

The legacy version 1 dataset was in place before 25 April 2020. The datasets have the 13 *'S'* indicators that the OxCGRT used in the months of March and April of 2020, early on at the start of the pandemic. **S1-S7** are policy decisions relating to various kinds of public gatherings recorded on an ordinal scale. **S8-S11** are financial indicators recorded as continuous variables. **S12** and **S13** relate to COVID-19 testing and contact tracing. **S1-S6** are further classified as either *"targeted"* (meaning they apply only in a geographically concentrated area) or *"general"* (meaning they apply throughout the entire jurisdiction). This data structure is further described in this [working paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-04/BSG-WP-2020-031-v4.0_0.pdf).

The legacy version 1 dataset produced the first version (or legacy version) of the *stringency index*. The methodology used to calculate the *legacy stringency index* is found [here](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/index_methodology.md#april-2020-legacy-stringency-index).

The legacy version 1 dataset is currently available from [OxCGRT's legacy GitHub repository](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker-legacy) at this [directory](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker-legacy/blob/main/legacy_data_20200425). The legacy version 1 dataset was also briefly available via and application programming interface (API) but was immediately superseded by a second version when legacy version 2 of the dataset was initiated (see next section).

### Legacy version 2

**Start date:** 28 April 2020
**~Retirement date:** 27 July 2022

OxCGRT expanded to 21 indicators of government response. Full descriptions of the policy indicators and their meaning can be found [here](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md#indicators-for-targeted-policies). This version also included statistics on the number of reported Covid-19 cases and deaths in each country. These were taken from the [JHU CSSE data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for all countries and the US States. The OxCGRT legacy version 2 datasets also included some subnational data for US states, Brazilian States, Indian States, UK devolved nations, Canadian provinces and territories, and Chinese provinces.

In addition to an updated *stringency index*, four additional indices that aggregate the data into a single number were developed. These are described [here](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/index_methodology.md#indices) and the calculation defined [here](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/index_methodology.md#index-calculation).

The OxCGRT lecacy version 2 datasets is currently available from [OxCGRT's legacy GitHub repository](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker-legacy) at this [directory](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker-legacy/blob/main/legacy_data_202207). This version of the OxCGRT datasets was also made available via a [version 2 of the OxCGRT API](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/covid-19-government-response-tracker/covid-tracker-api) which is formally declared as unsupported but continue to still be accessible.

### Current and final dataset

**Start date:** July 2022
**Date of final release:** June 2023

From the end of July 2022, the data structure was again evolved to take into account the need to differentiate policies applying to vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. This brought about breaking changes to the previous data structure and the need to produce additional data file outputs. The OxCGRT stopped publishing real-time updates at the end of 2022. A final version of the OxCGRT dataset is available at https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-dataset. The final version of the dataset has more jurisdictions and more consistency in data format between files. No API support is provided for this version of the dataset.


## What does `oxcgrt` do?

The `oxcgrt` package facilitates access to the various OxCGRT data versions for [R](https://cran.r-project.org) users. This package also includes functions to calculate the various OxCGRT indices. This package is aimed at [R](https://cran.r-project.org) users who use or plan to use the OxCGRT data for their research or for other academic purposes or who develop or want to develop other metrics or indices that build on the OxCGRT approach.

The `oxcgrt` package has two main sets of functions that:

1. Retrieve various versions of the OxCGRT datasets (`get_*` functions); and,

2. Calculate various OxCGRT indicators, sub-indices and indices (`calculate_*` functions).

There are other R packages that provide access to data from the OxCGRT. The [`COVID19` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=COVID19) and the [`oxcovid19` package](https://como-ph.github.io/oxcovid19/) are just two examples of these. However, all these packages provide access to the OxCGRT data as *data dumps* and only for the time-series of the stringency index per country. To our knowledge, the `oxcgrt` package is the only R package currently that provides an interface to the various versions of the OxCGRT datasets available. Also, the `oxcgrt` package provides functions to calculate the OxCGRT sub-indices and indices based on their methodology. None of the other R packages that we have seen and reviewed have this functionality.

## Installation

You can install the released version of oxcgrt from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("oxcgrt")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("OxfordIHTM/oxcgrt")
```

## Usage

### The `oxcgrt` data retrieval workflow via API

The *retrieve data* functions are based on the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)'s JSON API described [here](https://covidtrackerapi.bsg.ox.ac.uk). Two API endpoints are provided: 1) endpoint for JSON providing data for stringency index by country over time; and, 2) endpoint for JSON providing data on policy actions and stringency index for a specific country on a specific day.

For each of these endpoints, the data retrieval workflow is composed of two steps: first is the creation of the appropriate API URL query; and, second is the retrieval of the appropriate data as per query into a data.frame structure usable in R. This workflow is show in code below:

```{r usage1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## Load oxcgrt package
library(oxcgrt)

## Step 1: Create the appropriate API URL query for time series data from 
## 1 June 2020 up to current day
query <- get_json_time(from = "2020-06-01")

## Step 2: Retrieve the data
get_data_time(query)
```

This results in the following:

```{r usage1a, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
## Load oxcgrt package
library(oxcgrt)

## Step 1: Create the appropriate API URL query for time series data from 
## 1 June 2020 up to current day
query <- get_json_time(from = "2020-06-01")

## Step 2: Retrieve the data
get_data_time(query)
```

The `oxcgrt` functions are designed to work with pipe operators via the `magrittr` package. The steps shown above can be replicated using pipe operators as follows:

```{r usage2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## Load magrittr package
library(magrittr)

get_json_time(from = "2020-06-01") %>%    ## Step 1: Creat API URL query
  get_data_time()                         ## Step 2: Retrieve data
```

This results in the same output as the earlier workflow albeit sorted alphabetically by country code:

```{r usage2a, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
## Load magrittr  package
library(magrittr)

get_json_time(from = "2020-06-01") %>%    ## Step 1: Creat API URL query
  get_data_time()                         ## Step 2: Retrieve data
```

For more detailed examples of how to retrieve data via the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) API version 2, read [Retrieve data via OxCGRT API](https://oxford-ihtm.io/oxcgrt/articles/retrieve.html).

### The `oxcgrt` calculate workflow

The `calculate_*` functions are based on the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)'s methodology described [here](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/index_methodology.md). There are two sets of calculate functions included in `oxcgrt`. The first calculates the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) **sub-indices** and the second calculates the four [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) **indices** which are composed of various combinations of the indicators used by [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) sub-indices and indices.

For more detailed examples of how to calculate the various [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) sub-indices and indices, read [Calculate OxCGRT sub-indices and indices](https://oxford-ihtm.io/oxcgrt/articles/calculate.html).

### Datasets

The `oxcgrt` package comes with helpful datasets which serve as guides to facilitate in usage and interpretation of the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) data.

#### Codebook

The [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) provides an authoritative codebook found [here](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md). The `oxcgrt` package has extracted the tables from this documentation into a single codebook that can serve as a handy and convenient reference for an [R](https://cran.r-project.org) user when working with [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) data in [R](https://cran.r-project.org). The [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) codebook can be accessed as follows:

```{r usage13, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
codebook
```

which outputs the codebook as a singular table in `tbl` format as shown below:

```{r usage13a, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
codebook
```

The current `oxcgrt` package version includes the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) **codebook version 3.7** released on 11 March 2022.

#### Example OxCGRT indicators dataset

In the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) methodology [document](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/index_methodology.md), an example indicator dataset is used to demonstrate the calculation of per indicator sub-indices and the four main indices that [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) provides. This example dataset has been made available in table format in the `oxcgrt` package and can be accessed as follows:

```{r usage14, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
indicatorData
```

which outputs the example data as a singular table in `tbl` format as shown below:

```{r usage14a, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
indicatorData
```

This dataset is used by the `oxcgrt` package to test the `calculate_*` functions and for demonstrating how these functions work. This dataset can be useful for those trying to learn the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)'s calculation methods and [R](https://cran.r-project.org) users who are learning how to use the `oxcgrt` package `calculate_*` functions.

## Limitations

The current version of `oxcgrt` package is *experimental* in that its stability and future development would depend on the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)'s current and future development. The [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) is in continuous evolution given that the COVID-19 pandemic is still on-going and various governments' responses to it are continuously changed and/or updated. The [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) has also been developing other indices that capture other aspects of governments' responses not yet covered by current indices.

The `oxcgrt` package author and maintainer commit to ensuring that current functions are maintained and/or updated in a manner that ensures backwards compatibility should changes to the data structure and/or to the indices calculation are implemented by the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) team. This would include maintaining the arguments used by the current functions, maintaining the functionality of the current functions, and maintaining the type of outputs of the current functions. Should changes implemented by the [OxCGRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) team to the data structure and/or to the indices calculation require the breaking of the syntax, functionality and/or outputs of the current functions, a formal and proper deprecation process will be implemented that include proper and detailed documentation of the changes and the potential impact on current users.
