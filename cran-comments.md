## Resubmission No. 2
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* I have added edited the web reference for the API that I provided in the first
resubmission. When clicking on the link I provided before, it does get to the
appropriate page. But I think CRAN is using a proper URL validator. To get
around this, I chose a more robust link that talks about the specific API of
interest. I tested this link on a URL validator and I did not get any errors.
Hopefully this does the trick. Thank you for your patience.
